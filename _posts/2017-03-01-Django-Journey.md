I kicked my old Jekyll blog to the curb and built this one with Django. What a thrilling ride this has been! And challenging.

My first project was a catalog of books, essentially a library web application. I followed Mozilla’s server-side web programming tutorial and learned the basics of Django URL’s schemes, templates, user logins and permissions, creating models and using SQLite and PostrgreSQL databases and deploying to Heroku.

I was able to use the foundations I’d learned from Mozilla as a launching point to redesign my personal blog. I also taught myself how to host static and media files and connect with AWS S3.

I really like Django. I feel at home using Python and I see a lot of power and potential in the framework. Unfortunately, there’s not a lot of beginner-friendly tutorials out there. There are a lot of inspiring, advanced GitHub repositories that make my eyes twinkle, but most of the tutorials assume intermediate knowledge. For example, to get AWS S3 to serve my media files I had to read three different tutorials, one of them written in 2014, to compile what I needed to know. Similarly, the Django documentation does a great job clarifying its features but it doesn’t provide many examples of them in use.
