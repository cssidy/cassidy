          <h2>Hello, I’m Cassidy.</h2>

          <p>I have an original mind bent on solving real problems. I employ design principles and 
            thoughtful code to build seamless experiences on the web.</p>

          <p>Besides telling computers what to do, I’m good at doing what computers have a hard time with. Diverse 
            high-level thinking, interdisciplinary
              synthesis, reasoning within context, and making decisions that involve value
              systems and ethics. I enjoy thinking about the philosophy behind what humans do.</p>

          <p>I am based in the small, idyllic city of Burlington, VT.
              When I’m not building web apps, I’m often engaged in art and music, or researching some topic that’s captured
              my interest.</p>

          <h2>What types of web apps do I make?</h2>

          <p>I want to build systems that improve the human experience without harming the planet. 
            I always consider the ethical consequences of new technology. These are some
             areas that I care about:</p>

          <ul>
              <li>Renewable energy</li>
              <li>Resource management</li>
              <li>Waste and recycling</li>
              <li>Overpopulation</li>
              <li>Environmental systems</li>
              <li>Corruption</li>
          </ul>

          <p>I want to find ways for humankind to exist complimentary to nature, yet enjoy the comforts of modern
              technology. I imagine a world where the human species is sustainable without comprising the planet and
              other species. I think this is possible if we put our minds to it.</p>

          opportunities.</p>
